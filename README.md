# 🐾 Barky-Talk  
**Because sometimes… “woof” just isn’t enough.**  

Barky-Talk is a fun little React Native + Expo app that “translates” your dog’s barks into English.  
Totally simulated, utterly silly, and way more entertaining than it has any right to be.  

---

## 🎯 What It Does  
- Tap the glowing mic button to “listen” to a bark.  
- Choose **Clear**, **Random**, or **Spicy** bark translations.  
- Hear your dog’s “words” spoken aloud.  
- Laugh, because we both know your dog didn’t say that.

## 🖼 Screenshots

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)  
- [expo-speech](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/speech/) for voice output  
- A lot of imagination and zero actual canine linguistics
